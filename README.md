## Debugging

Here are three debugging methods:

1. Real-time Debugging
   Running yarn demo `<directory-name>` will execute the demo project in the demos directory corresponding to the specified directory name.

   Benefits:
   The console will print information about the execution of major steps, allowing you to visually track the execution flow.
   Hot updates are available (including updates to both demo code and source code).

2. Using yarn link
   Set up a React test project using CRA or Vite. In this project, execute yarn build to bundle react and react-dom. Then, use yarn link to replace the react and react-dom dependencies in the test project with the bundled versions.

   Benefits:
   This method is the closest to actual usage scenarios of React in a project.

3. Running Official React Test Cases
   Execute yarn test to run the official test cases, which use the react and react-dom versions bundled by executing yarn build.

   Benefits:
   This allows you to observe framework implementation details and edge cases from the perspective of official test cases.

## Changelog

### v1.0

Insert single node render phase mount process, including the following features:

- JSX conversion
- Fiber architecture
- Single node reconcile process

> Note: Rendering in the browser environment has not yet been implemented.

### v1.1

Mounting process for inserting a single node (rendering DOM in a browser environment), including the following functionalities:

- Browser environment DOM insertion
- Support for HostText type

### v1.2

Implement the mount process for useState, including the following functionalities:

- Support for FunctionComponent type
- Mount process implementation following the Hooks architecture
- Implementation of useState

### v1.3

Initialize the testing architecture with the following features:

- Set up the Jest environment
- Configure Babel
- Use ReactTestUtils
- Run the 20 official test cases related to ReactElement

### v1.4

Implement single-node update, including the following functionalities:

- Browser Environment DOM Deletion: For example, when an `<h3>` element changes to a `<p>` element, it should involve deleting the `<h3>` and inserting the `<p>`.
- Single Node Reconciliation Process: This includes reconciliation for HostComponent and HostText.
- Node Deletion Reconciliation Process: Prepare for subsequent ref and useEffect features with a thorough implementation.
- Hooks Architecture Update Implementation.

### v1.5

Implement an event system with the following features:

- Event Model
- Support for onClick events (as well as onClickCapture events)

### v1.6

Implemented the multi-node reconcile process (commonly known as the Diff algorithm), including the following features:

- Fixed a bug where onClick callbacks did not update during updates
- Insertion process for multiple nodes during mounting
- Reconciliation process for multiple nodes during insertion
- DOM movement in the browser environment
